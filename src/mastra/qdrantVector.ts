   * Parses and converts a string ID to the appropriate type (string or number) for Qdrant point operations.
   *
   * Qdrant supports both numeric and string IDs. This helper method ensures IDs are in the correct format
   * before sending them to the Qdrant client API.
   *
   * @param id - The ID string to parse
   * @returns The parsed ID as either a number (if string contains only digits) or the original string
   *
   * @example
   * // Numeric ID strings are converted to numbers
   * parsePointId("123") => 123
   * parsePointId("42") => 42
   * parsePointId("0") => 0
   *
   * // String IDs containing any non-digit characters remain as strings
   * parsePointId("doc-123") => "doc-123"
   * parsePointId("user_42") => "user_42"
   * parsePointId("abc123") => "abc123"
   * parsePointId("123abc") => "123abc"
   * parsePointId("") => ""
   * parsePointId("uuid-5678-xyz") => "uuid-5678-xyz"
   *
   * @remarks
   * - This conversion is important because Qdrant treats numeric and string IDs differently
   * - Only positive integers are converted to numbers (negative numbers with minus signs remain strings)
   * - The method uses base-10 parsing, so leading zeros will be dropped in numeric conversions
   * - reference: https://qdrant.tech/documentation/concepts/points/?q=qdrant+point+id#point-ids
